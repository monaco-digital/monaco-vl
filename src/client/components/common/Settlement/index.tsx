					If you’ve taken the previous steps to advance your case, please feel free to use the form on the on the next

				<p>For example, you may require our services if:</p>
				<Typography variant="body1" paragraph component="div">
					<ul className="list-disc">
						<li>You have received a settlement offer</li>
						<li>You would like a callback about your case</li>
					</ul>
				</Typography>
				<Typography variant="h5" paragraph>
					<strong>I have received a settlement offer</strong>
				</Typography>
				<Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
					<p>
						Contact Monaco Solicitors for a free consultation and we will be able to represent you, either to increase
						the amount or to review and sign the settlement agreement document itself.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						There is always an amount of money for legal fees, set out in the settlement agreement document itself. This
						sum is to cover the legal costs of going through the lengthy settlement agreement document with you.{' '}
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Reviewing and advising you on your settlement agreement does not cost you anything. Your lawyer would
						invoice your employer separately for this.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						We would then go through the settlement agreement in detail with you and discuss whether you should try to
						negotiate an increased amount.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>We might be able to do this on your behalf on a no win no fee basis.</p>
