			'## Advice\n\nVirtual Lawyer will advise whether or not you have a potential case against your employer, based on the information you’ve given us. Virtual Lawyer cannot advise on the strength of your case, but it will give you some pointers so that you can make an educated guess.\n\nIf you do have a case, it’s important to gather evidence as your employer will likely want to deny wrongdoing. The stronger your case, the more likely the employer is to settle it with you (although there are no guarantees and different employers act differently). This is why we refer to having a claim throughout the advice - it’s always in the shadow of your negotiations with your employer.',

			'## Time limits\n\nThis is very important. You should keep on top of the time limit for your case, even if you don’t intend to bring a claim at an employment tribunal. It’s essential for your bargaining power - once you’ve lost your right to issue a claim, the employer has no incentive to settle the case with you.\n\nTime limits for employment claims are short - three months minus one day from the last act complained of. In a claim for unfair dismissal or constructive dismissal, the time limit will run from your last day of employment. For other claims such as discrimination or whistleblowing, the time limit will normally run from the date of the employer’s alleged wrongdoing. When the treatment is ongoing, it will be the date of the last act. Time limits can occasionally be extended - however, we’d urge that you bring your claim promptly as you don’t want a dispute in the tribunal about this. More information on time limits: https://www.monacosolicitors.co.uk/tribunals/time-limits/.\n\nIf it’s getting close to the time limit expiring, you should contact Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) for early conciliation, which is a compulsory step before issuing a claim and it will give you a bit more time. For more information see: https://www.acas.org.uk/making-a-claim-to-an-employment-tribunal.',

			"## Consider submitting a grievance\n\nIf you're unhappy about the way you've been treated at work and have tried but failed to resolve the issue informally with your employer, then you should consider making a formal complaint or 'raising a grievance'.\n\nOnce your employer has received your grievance, they may realise that you have a case that you could win if you took it to an employment tribunal. If that’s so, they may decide that instead of spending their money on costly grievance procedures, they would prefer to put it towards compensation and an exit settlement for you.\n\nYou’re the one who has to initiate the grievance procedure. Your first step should be to read your employer’s grievance policy and procedures document. You’ll need to ensure that you correctly follow all the requirements set out there when you prepare and submit your grievance. (See our [Grievances Guide](https://www.monacosolicitors.co.uk/grievances/) for detail.)\n\nIf the grievance hearing panel finds against you, you should appeal the decision, saying why you think the outcome is unfair and with any new evidence to support your appeal.\n\nIf your appeal is rejected and you definitely want to leave, now is the time to revive any earlier negotiations you attempted with your employer. Your '**without prejudice**' letter would summarise your case and state what compensation and other terms you would accept by way of an '**exit settlement**'.  Virtual lawyer can help you write this letter.\n\nYou could also start an employment tribunal claim providing it’s lodged with [Acas](https://www.monacosolicitors.co.uk/tribunals/commencing-the-acas-pre-claim-process-for-employment-tribunals/) within three months (less one day) of the date of the incident(s) that led to your grievance.\n\n",

			"## If you’ve already submitted a grievance\n\nIf you have already submitted a grievance, you should allow a few working days from the date of your submission for your employer to respond. If you still haven’t heard, send an email/letter to check on receipt of your original submission and asking when you can expect a reply.\n\nIf the grievance hearing panel finds against you, you should [appeal](https://www.monacosolicitors.co.uk/appeals/) the decision in writing, saying why you think the outcome is unfair and with any new evidence to support your appeal.\n\nIf your appeal is rejected and you decide that you want to leave, now is the time to write a '[without prejudice](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/without-prejudice/)' letter summarising your case and stating what compensation and other terms you would accept by way of an [exit settlement](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/negotiations/). Virtual lawyer can help you write this letter.\n\nYou could also start an employment tribunal claim providing it’s lodged with [Acas](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/acas/) within three months (less one day) of the date of the incident(s) that led to your grievance.\n\n\n## If your grievance has been dismissed\n\nDon’t lose heart if your grievance has been rejected.  Keep up the momentum and make an [appeal](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/appeals/) against the decision. Your appeal should say why you think the outcome is unfair, biased or incorrect and provide any new evidence in your favour.\n\nIf your appeal is rejected and you want to leave, now is the time to write a ’[without prejudice](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/without-prejudice/)' letter summarising your case and stating what compensation and other terms you would accept by way of an [exit settlement](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/negotiations/). Virtual lawyer can help you write this letter.\n\nYou could also start an employment tribunal claim which must be notified to [Acas](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/acas/) within three months (less one day) of the date of the incident(s) that led to your grievance.\n\n\n## If you are going to appeal the outcome of your grievance\n\nDon’t lose heart if your grievance has been rejected.  Keep up the momentum and make an [appeal](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/appeals/) against the decision. Your appeal should say why you think the outcome is unfair and also include any new evidence in your favour.\n\nIf your appeal is rejected and you want to leave, now is the time to write a ‘[without prejudice](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/without-prejudice/)' letter summarising your case and stating what compensation and other terms you would accept by way of an [exit settlement](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/negotiations/). Virtual lawyer can help you write this letter.\n\nYou could also start an employment tribunal claim which must be notified to [Acas](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/acas/) within three months (less one day) of the date of the incident(s) that led to your grievance.\n\n\n## If your grievance was dismissed and then upheld on appeal\n\nWell done! If your grievance appeal is upheld, it means that your employer now accepts your grievance and no longer disputes it.\n\nIf you have got this far with the grievance procedure, then you have two main options:  to stay with your employer or to leave.\n\nIf you want to stay, you will have to work with your employer to put right the wrongs that lead to you raising your original grievance.\n\nIf you want to leave, now is the time to write a '[without prejudice](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/without-prejudice/)' letter summarising your case and stating what compensation and other terms you would accept by way of an exit settlement. Virtual Lawyer can help you write this letter.\n\nYou could also start an employment tribunal claim which must be notified to [Acas](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/acas/) within three months (less one day) of the date of the incident(s) that led to your grievance.\n\n\n## If your grievance was dismissed and then partially upheld on appeal\n\nIf your grievance was only partially upheld on appeal, this means that your employer is likely to have found in your favour on a small point (for example, on how the grievance was carried out) but that they rejected the main substance of your grievance.\n\nWhatever your employer’s motives for reaching this conclusion, there is still a good chance that you can negotiate fair compensation and an exit settlement agreement.\n\nSo now is the time to write a ‘[without prejudice](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/without-prejudice/)' letter summarising your case and stating what compensation and other terms you would accept by way of an [exit settlement](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/negotiations/). Virtual lawyer can help you write this letter.\n\nYou could also start an [employment tribunal](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/tribunals/) claim at this time, which must be notified to [Acas](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/acas/) within three months (less one day) of the date of the incident(s) that led to your grievance.\n\n\n## What was the approximate date of your grievance?\n\nThe date of your grievance is really important because there are [strict time limits](https://www.monacosolicitors.co.uk/tribunals/time-limits/) within which you can bring an [employment tribunal claim](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/tribunals/).\n\nThe time limits are three months less one day from the date of the incident or incidents that you complained about in your grievance. If you leave it any longer, it is unlikely that you will be able to make an employment tribunal claim.\n\nThis means that by now you probably have less than three months left to submit an employment tribunal claim, so you really need to act promptly and get in touch with [Acas](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/acas/) at the earliest opportunity to register your intention to make a claim.\n\n",

			'## Risk of redundancy\n\nRedundancy means dismissal because your employer needs fewer employees to do your type of work than previously. Your employer is within their rights to make redundancies, but two main conditions have to be met for the redundancy to be lawful: \n\n(1) there has to be a genuine reduction in the amount of the type of work that you do \n\n(2) a fair redundancy process must be followed. That includes adequate consultation, as well as fair means of selecting people for redundancy. Your employer also has to try to keep you employed, for example by offering you the opportunity to apply for an alternative position. \n\nSelection methods that discriminate against an individual or discrimination at any other stage of the process make a [redundancy unfair](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/redundancy/fair/). The same applies if you are selected for redundancy because of your [whistleblowing](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/whistleblowing/) or taking action to protect your [health and safety](https://www.monacosolicitors.co.uk/coronavirus/unfair-dismissal-paycuts-bullying-coronavirus-health-safety-at-work/). \n\nSee our [Redundancy guide](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/redundancy/) for more detail.\n\n',

			"## Performance issues\n\nYour employer is entitled to raise performance issues with you if they're not happy with your work, but they need to give you an opportunity to improve and to follow a fair procedure in so doing. \n\nThis normally involves a properly implemented performance review with a [performance improvement plan (PIP)](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/performance/). The plan is meant to help you improve your performance in order to meet defined goals. In practice, however, it's often used by an employer to start a dismissal process.\n\nThe good news is that many employers will prefer to [negotiate an exit package](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/negotiations/) swiftly with you, rather than conduct lengthy performance proceedings which cost them in terms of productivity and management time. So, the sooner you start negotiating the better. \n\nYou may also have a [discrimination claim](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/discrimination/) if the performance issues are related to your [disability](https://www.monacosolicitors.co.uk/discrimination/disability/) or if the employer is raising them for other discriminatory reasons or the PIP is implemented in a discriminatory way. You might also have a claim if the performance review is in retaliation to your [whistleblowing]http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/whistleblowing/() or to you taking action to protect your [health and safety](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/coronavirus/unfair).\n\n## If your performance review or performance improvement plan is ongoing\n\nWe're sorry to hear you're having to deal with this. Try to take a step back and look at your situation objectively. Does your manager really want to help you do your job better, or is this simply an attempt to push you out of the organisation? If it's the latter, it might be worth negotiating with them to see if you can reach agreeable terms to leave your employment with a [financial settlement](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/settlement-agreement/).\n\nVirtual Lawyer can help you with a letter to get your settlement negotiations underway. But it’s a good idea to [get in touch](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/contact-us/) with an employment lawyer as soon as you can for advice on how to act, what actions to take, and what to keep a record of. \n\n## If you've passed your performance review or performance improvement plan \n\nWell done. Passing a performance improvement plan (PIP) demonstrates that there has been a vast improvement in your work or possibly that there was little justification for starting the process in the first place. \n\nIf your employer was attempting to use the PIP as an excuse for dismissing you, then they may now offer you an exit settlement. If they don’t offer you a settlement and you want to leave, you should start settlement discussions. As you've already succeeded in passing the PIP, your employer should realise that you merit an attractive exit package.Virtual Lawyer can help you create a suitable letter as your first step.\n\n## What if you've failed your performance review or performance improvement plan? \n\nWe're sorry to hear this. The end of a PIP process which you’ve failed can be a tricky time to negotiate as your employer will feel that a [fair dismissal](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/unfair-dismissal/) is within their sights. \n\nHowever, you may have a long list of reasons why you believe the performance review process was unfair and potentially at odds with your employers’ usual performance procedures. If the evidence you have is sufficient as the basis for an unfair dismissal claim, it will be invaluable in negotiations for an exit settlement. \n\nYou can use Virtual Lawyer to help you write a 'without prejudice' letter as your first step in negotiations with your employer. But also consider seeking advice from a specialist solicitor on the best tactics to adopt. \n\n",

If your [sick pay](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/sick-pay/) hasn’t been paid, you may have an unfair deductions of wages claim.\n\nYour dismissal may be unlawful if your sickness absence was because of a disability  - assuming your employer knew that you had a disability. In this case you may be able to claim for [disability discrimination](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/discrimination/disability/).\n\n## Consider having an Occupational Health assessment at work\n\nOccupational health advisers are there to advise your employer on your health issues. Their reports can be useful for helping you stay in your job or for negotiating an exit. \n\nIf you think there are any ways that your employment has caused your illness, present these issues to your occupational health adviser for their assessment. If your doctor has signed you ‘fit to work’, but your employer is waiting on an occupational health decision and report before letting you return, you should be paid even if your allocated sick leave has expired. \n\n## Consider taking sick leave\n\nTypically if your employer is using a bogus process to get rid of you, it becomes very stressful, so you might consider seeing a doctor to be signed off on sick leave. This makes it more difficult for your employer to continue with their action against you and so they may be more willing to [negotiate an exit package](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/negotiations/) with you. There is no need to remain in the office if your employer’s unfair treatment is making you ill.\n\n## If you’ve been signed off sick for longer than 12 months\n\nAn illness can amount to a disability if it’s likely to last more than 12 months. If you are classified as disabled, your employer has  to make adjustments to accommodate your illness. If organising return-to-work adjustments for your role is likely to be difficult for your employer and you're willing to take [a settlement](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/settlement-agreements/), they may be prepared to pay you to leave instead of facing a [disability discrimination](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/discrimination/disability/) claim.\n\n## How much paid sick leave have you got left?\n\nHowever much sick leave you have remaining, if you’d like to leave your employment with a [settlement](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/settlement-agreements/) it’s important to [start negotiations](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/negotiations/) as soon as possible. \n\nYour employer will be keener to pay you off if you’re costing them money without doing your job. For example, if they can see that you’re guaranteed to remain off sick for three months, but they’re still paying you, they will find the idea of a settlement more appealing than if you only have a couple of weeks of sick pay left. \n\nConsider consulting experienced specialist employment lawyers - like [Monaco Solicitors](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/contact-us/) - who will know how to approach your employer and which tactics are best to employ in order to secure the best possible settlement for you. \n\n## Are you currently signed off sick and on full pay?\n\nWhile you are signed off sick and on full pay,  and you want to [negotiate an exit package](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/negotiations/) to leave your job, you’re best placed to do so while you’re still on full pay. This is because at this point there is a real monetary benefit to your employer in agreeing an exit package with you.\n\n## Are you currently signed off on reduced pay?\n\nIf you want to negotiate an exit package you should do so as soon as possible if you're already on reduced pay.\n\nYou could try consulting experienced employment lawyers - such as [Monaco Solicitors](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/contact-us/) - as their experience can help you reach a settlement swiftly while you still have bargaining power.\n\n## Are you currently signed off on zero pay?\n\nIf your sickness is due to issues in your employment, it’s unlikely to improve until or unless the issues are resolved, so you should take steps to have your issues resolved as soon as possible.\n\nThere may still be a chance of being able to negotiate a fair [exit settlement](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/settlement-agreements/) with your employer if you think they will put you on something like a [performance review](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/performance/) when you return to work. A performance review is a lengthy and costly process for them and they may instead consider paying you the money in the form of an exit settlement.\n\n",

			'## Disability discrimination\n\nThe law defines disability as a long-term condition that has a substantial effect on day-to-day activities. ‘Long-term’ means you need to have had it for over a year, and ‘condition’ can be either physical or mental health-related. \n\nIf you can identify when and how you have been discriminated against because of your disability and have the[evidence](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/evidence) to prove it, you could negotiate an attractive exit settlement agreement. \n\nAs this is such a complicated area of law, we strongly recommend that you consult an experienced firm of employment law solicitors such as [Monaco Solicitors](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/contact-us/) to help you with your case.\n\n',

			"## Pregnancy disrimination\n\nPregnancy discrimination at work is still very common, so understandably the decision when to tell your employer about your pregnancy is not an easy one. Many employers will be perfectly fine with that (as they should be), but women often find that problems start after they announce they are pregnant.\n\nIn practice, it can be difficult to prove pregnancy discrimination as your employer will typically deny it. You have to prove that they knew you were pregnant and that their less favourable treatment of you (eg performance management, transfer, dismissal etc) was in fact because of your pregnancy. \n\nThe good thing is that you don’t need to show that you were discriminated against by comparing yourself with other employees. it's enough to show unfavourable treatment because of your pregnancy.  See also our guide on [Pregnancy and maternity discrimination](https://www.monacosolicitors.co.uk/discrimination/maternity-and-pregnancy/) in the workplace.\n\n",

			'## Maternity discrimination\n\nLike pregnancy, maternity discrimination is unfortunately very common. Many women returning from maternity leave are offered unfavourable settlement agreements or redundancy payments because their employer has decided that it can either do without them or that childcare will inhibit their ability to fulfil their duties at work.\n\nAny decision by an employer to dismiss you either during or upon your return from maternity leaves them vulnerable to you making a discrimination claim against them. \n\nYou need to [gather evidence](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/evidence/) and start thinking about your strategy immediately if you have reason to believe that you’re being discriminated against because of this.

			'## Race discrimination\n\nRace discrimination covers race, colour, nationality, ethnic and national origins. Sadly, race discrimination is still all too common in the workplace. Most instances are in the form of direct discrimination (treating a Person A less favourably than Person B because of their race etc) or harassment because of a person’s race (e.g. making racist jokes). \n\nThe difficulty is that these days direct race discrimination tends to be insidious, rather than overt. There is often very little documentary [evidence](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/evidence/) available and you can expect your employers to deny it. See our [Race discrimination guide](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/discrimination/race/) for more about this.\n\nOur Virtual Lawyer letter builder can help you put together your arguments in the form of a grievance or ‘without prejudice’ letter depending on whether you want to stay or leave your employment. However, a specialist employment solicitor with experience of winning race discrimination cases can really make a difference in assessing the evidence and in presenting your case.\n\n',

			"## Sex discrimination\n\nThis relates to discrimination against men or women. The vast majority of sex discrimination is against women, but it's possible for a man to claim it as well. \n\nEqual pay is a good example of sex discrimination, You may have an equal pay claim if you are paid less than a colleague of the opposite sex for equal work or work of equal value. Technically, either a man or a woman can bring an equal pay claim, but in practice, women tend to be underpaid compared to men, as shown by government [gender pay-gap reports](https://gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk/). \n\nSee our [guide on Sex discrimination](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/discrimination/sex/) for further details and practical guidance.\n\n",

			"## Sexual Orientation\n\nThis relates to sexual attraction to people of the same sex, different sex or both - broadly speaking, gay, lesbian, straight or bisexual orientation. \n\nSexual orientation discrimination is still common in many workplaces. For example, your employer or colleagues may not like you referring to your same-sex partner or frequenting certain places associated with being gay. Subjecting you to any less favourable treatment because of this is unlawful. \n\nAs with all other forms of discrimination, the key is to collect strong evidence to support your case and to present it in a coherent and logical way to your employer  Your letter may seek a resolution to enable you to stay in your employment or be a '[without prejudice](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/without-prejudice/)' letter which proposes an [exit settlement](http://monacosolicitors.co.uk/settlement-agreements/) with compensation.\n\nAs discrimination is such a complex area of law, you would be advised to consult a specialist employment solicitor with proven experience in this area at an early stage.\n\n",

Victimisation is when you are treated badly because you have made a ‘protected act‘ (or because it is believed that you have done or are going to do so). A protected act is making a complaint of discrimination (discrimination against yourself or anybody else) or offering assistance to someone else with their discrimination claim.
