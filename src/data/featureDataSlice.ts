 * Store for feature switching.
 *
 * Features under development should be initially committed in a disabled state so the code can deploy to prod without breaking anything.
 * After the feature is fully ready for users, change initialState to true to switch it on for everyone.
 *
 * Feature can be enabled in a single session by setting ?enableMonetization=true in the query string (see <main> component).
 *
 * Feature switches should be regularly cleaned up and removed from the codebase once the feature is permanently enabled in prod.
